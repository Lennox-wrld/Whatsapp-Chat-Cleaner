7/1/23, 22:35 - +254 721 337221: Intercropping is ....
You have your avocado as the main crop and target crop, but then because you have the interval of 6m from bed to bed, you decide not to leave the space empty, so you can maintain the interroads by planting short crops that will not grow and give a shadow to the trees.
7/1/23, 22:49 - MrPatrick: What crop was it in the photo

7/4/23, 16:15 - +254 721 337221: Good evening all,
This is to bring to your attention that no seedlings will be replaced without a report on why we are replacing and the cause.
The field officers should be able to observe the dead seedlings and see the possible causes of dead plants then make a report that will be used to determine whether it's our seedlings quality or a problem caused by the farmer himself.
Then we will decide if he buys again the replacement seedlings or we carry the cost.
Kindly I hope am clear if not understood please call.
Rgds,
Linci sm

7/11/23, 05:49 - MrPatrick: *‚ùó3 MAJOR PROTESTS TO TAKE PLACE ON WEDNESDAY: ‚ùó* 


‚ñ† Warnings are spreading out that Kenyans should prepare for major disruptions on Wednesday, July 12, as the nation anticipates three significant protests across different sectors. 

‚ñ† These demonstrations are likely to have a considerable impact on day-to-day operations with projected depth pitted to be bigger than the previous protests.

‚ñ† The occurrence of these simultaneous events can be attributed to the disillusionment felt by Kenyans regarding the soaring cost of living and contentious tax hikes.

‚ñ† The strike notices issued by various key stakeholders are also expected to paralyze the transport sector, forcing Kenyans to seek alternative means to head to work.


‚óè Taxi association protests

‚ñ† Taxi-hailing apps announced a nationwide strike on Wednesday, July 12, over various issues ailing the transport sector. 

‚ñ† The leadership of the  taxi-hailing association highlighted several key concerns that they seek to address, which include; insecurity, escalating fuel prices, and pay rates set by digital companies.


‚ñ† A strict warning was also sent to all taxi-hailing drivers to keep their cars off the road during the strike. 

‚ñ† The leadership argued that the strike would continue until their demands are met by the government.

"Do not try to put your car on the road. We are warning you not to try to test the waters on the day of the strike," a source has intimated.

‚óè PSV Protests

‚ñ† On June 21, 2023, Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) issued a 21-day strike notice over the mandatory re-testing exercise conducted by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA).
 The deadline is set to lapse on Wednesday, July 12.

‚ñ† Supported by long-distance drivers and boda boda operators, the PSV operators argued that the mandatory re-testing was punitive and aimed at frustrating motorists.

‚ñ† They sought to be involved in the decision-making process in a bid to guarantee positive changes within the sector.

"The association calls for constructive dialogue between the Ministry of Transport, the NTSA, and stakeholders to address concerns and find mutually beneficial solutions that prioritise safety while supporting driver's well-being," read part of a statement by the Long-Distance Drivers and Conductors Association (LODDCA).

‚ñ† Azimio Protest

‚óè During the Saba Saba demonstrations, Azimio la Umoja Raila Odinga announced nationwide protests that would continue his clarion call for civil disobedience. 
‚óè He warned the Kenya Kwanza administration that issues such as punitive taxes and the high cost of living were non-negotiable.

"And come next week July 12 (Wednesday) we're going to have more serious demonstrations across the country," stated National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi.

"Today (on July 7) was the beginning of this new wave of civil disobedience and mass action," he added.

‚ñ† While making his remarks, the opposition leader rallied behind the push to collect 10 million signatures - a statement which drew criticism from the Kenya Kwanza leaders who argued that the signatures could not kick out President William Ruto from office and this is an attempt to overthrow government which will be met with the full wrath as intimated by Kenya Kwanza.

‚ñ† Wednesday is projected to be vicious especially after threats that Opposition leader could be arrested an issue thst could ignite abrassion along streets of the capital.

‚ñ† Plan your schedules accordingly .

This is a good response from those seedlings. 
Give them more 2 weeks and please water daily and you are ok to go with the best seedlings.
7/18/23, 16:04 - +254 721 337221: Malava:

7/18/23, 16:06 - +254 721 337221: Ambassador Kadima:
How are the trees that we replaced at the demo farm?
How are the old ones at the demo farm?
How are the seedlings?
7/18/23, 16:06 - +254 721 337221: Faith:
What is the state of the farms you have visited? Are we moving on well basing on age, quality and irrigation?
7/18/23, 16:14 - +254 714 783208: Good evening team
Most of the farms are doing okay.
The farms that were having issues with some of the seedlings got a replacement.
Some of the first farmers who planted avocado were struggling with their trees but after a couple of visits they are now seeing improvement
7/18/23, 16:20 - +254 721 337221: Great,
Can you also start advising on nutrition and fertigation as we need to start raising the trees on a right path than correcting later. 
Hygiene
Prunning
Fertigation
7/18/23, 16:20 - +254 721 337221: Irrigation
7/18/23, 16:24 - +254 714 783208: Sawa
7/18/23, 16:24 - +254 721 337221: It should reflect all your records as what you started at kaimosi.
When am there I need to see some files on Kaimosi farm, and all other farms we have started.
On the things mentioned:
Land preparation
Seedlings date of propagation
Date of planting and dimensions
Water/type of irrigation in place
How many times irrigation is done
Replacement dates if any
Reason for replacement
Prunning dates
Weeding dates
Fertilizer application dates
Any other activities
7/18/23, 16:26 - +254 721 337221: Ambassadors help on making sure the field guys are keeping records and anything happening everyday in the farms you are manning. 
Faith give then formats/ sheets to use.
7/18/23, 16:41 - +254 714 783208: Okay
7/18/23, 16:45 - +254 721 337221: Great
7/18/23, 16:46 - +254 721 337221: Also start developing a sheet that will have all problems you see on different farms for your quality checks, Different farms have different issues technically.
7/18/23, 18:23 - +254 719 852892: This is so interesting and  encouraging!

7/20/23, 15:20 - +254 719 852892: Today in Malava we still went around visiting schools to preach to them the gospel of avocado planting. 1 we visited st Antony Kakoyi sec sch where we met the principal and has given us an appointment to go back n talk to her teachers.
2 we visited Mang'uliro pri where we were able to talk to the deputy head and she also gave us an appointment to still go back to talk to the whole staff
3 At Mang'uliro sec sch we met the deputy principal whereby  we had a great conversation and he has given us an appointment go to his home and check his farm, he is readyto plant with us.
4 At Kakunga pri we met the whole staff whereby we talked to them and we had very great positive response, quite a no of teachers have shown interest in avocado farming.
So generally we got very positive response from all the institutions we visited

7/31/23, 21:50 - +254 721 337221: A very sad story. Unfortunately I had to face it head-on. This was the case of an export company called Kilimambogo packers stationed in Thika, trying to steal my Hass avocados in a clever way. What saved me was both my sixth sense and subconscious mind. It was the kind of theft that would have made me almost lose my mind  if I discovered much later.

They plucked my Hass avocados today at the agreed price of 85/- per kg. We weighed all the 120 crates. They had an electronic which all of us trust. I have never questioned an electronic weighing scale.

I was abit surprised that all my avocados weighed about 1,200kg. For some reason as the process finished and the reality was eating me up, I decided to do the unthinkable, weigh myself. I weighed 75kg, but in a matter of seconds it dawned on me that my weight is 85kg and not 75kg. I must have gone berserk. 

By this time the weighing scale had already been taken to the lorry in preparation to leave. I rushed to the vehicle and asked for the scale because my weight is not 75kg. They took it out. Put it on a flat surface, and this time round I weighed 90kg. I shouted, I don't weigh 90kg. Everyone smelt a rat. 

I told  the supervisor by name Stephen, that this was a police case. My head was asking me, how many farmers had fleeced like that. We rushed to the police station. We came back with the police officer and said we take weight of one crate. This time round the machine was working well and gave us a correct weight, though double what had been declared before. My hand spring balance matched the weight.

It was now an easy case which the officer termed a fraud. My entire sale had been halved. Instead of 1,200kg, it should have been 2,400kg. They paid that without an argument. 

We spared them the  trouble of the lorry being impounded and all the produce going to waste plus a lengthy court case.

How many farmers have they stolen from in Embu which is their main domain? That is what a peasant farmer is going through in the hands of a trusted exporter who is respected for having a fleet of lorries.
7/31/23, 23:24 - MrPatrick: Very sad indeed
8/1/23, 06:54 - +254 724 957698: This is  common practice among all produce buyers. In the maize sector, this has led to farmers abandoning maize farming altogether. From this example, the only way out is for producers to band together and do everything cooperatively.  This will call for strong cooperatives that can stand up to some of these rascals.
8/1/23, 07:16 - MrPatrick: üëçüèΩ

I have encouraged youth to embrace agriculture more so avocado farming. This is the surest way of solving the unemployment crisis in the country. 

The crop, now being referred to as green gold, is fetching good money both in local and international markets.

Delighted to attend the launch of SiSi Village Produce, a non-governmental organization that has set base at Musikoma Ward, Kanduyi Constituency. 

The group is empowering youth through the cultivation of a new breed of Avocado called Hass Avocado; a pest-resistant crop that favors our soil and has rich nutritional value.
