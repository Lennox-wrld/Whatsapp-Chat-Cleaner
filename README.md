# Whatsapp-Chat-Cleaner
Cleans whatsapp exported chat data to make it usable as a machine learning dataset. It removes useless text like datetimes, media and others.
It's rewritten in Python, fuck js.

## HOW TO USE:
1 run the cleaner.py file.
2 add the filepath of the textfile to be cleaned eg /user/filepath/to/be/cleaned.
3 add the path for the cleaned text eg /user/docs/cleaned/.
