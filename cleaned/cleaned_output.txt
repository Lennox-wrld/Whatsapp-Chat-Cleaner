254 721 337221: a very sad story. unfortunately i had to face it head-on. this was the case of an export company called kilimambogo packers stationed in thika, trying to steal my hass avocados in a clever way. what saved me was both my sixth sense and subconscious mind. it was the kind of theft that would have made me almost lose my mind  if i discovered much later.
rpatrick: very sad indeed
54 724 957698: this is  common practice among all produce buyers. in the maize sector, this has led to farmers abandoning maize farming altogether. from this example, the only way out is for producers to band together and do everything cooperatively.  this will call for strong cooperatives that can stand up to some of these rascals.
patrick: 👍🏽
